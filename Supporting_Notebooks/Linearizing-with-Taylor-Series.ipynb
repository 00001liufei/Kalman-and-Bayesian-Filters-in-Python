    "# Linearizing with Taylor Series\n",
    "\n",
    "Taylor series represents a function as an infinite sum of terms. The terms are linear, even for a nonlinear function, so we can express any arbitrary nonlinear function using linear algebra. The cost of this choice is that unless we use an infinite number of terms the value we compute will be approximate rather than exact.\n",

      "### Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The last chapter ended by discussing some of the drawbacks of the Discrete Bayesian filter. For many tracking and filtering problems our desire is to have a filter that is *unimodal* and *continuous*. That is, we want to model our system using floating point math (continuous) and to have only one belief represented (unimodal). For example, we want to say an aircraft is at (12.34381, -95.54321,2389.5) where that is latitude, longitude, and altidue. We do not want our filter to tell us \"it might be at (1,65,78) or at (34,656,98)\" That doesn't match our physical intuition of how the world works, and as we discussed, it is prohibitively expensive to compute.\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "<div style=\"border:1px black;background-color:#DCDCDC#\">So we desire a unimodal, continuous way to represent probabilities that models how the real world works, and that is very computationally efficient to calculate. As you might guess from the chapter name, Gaussian distributions provide all of these features.</div>\n",

      "Probably this is immediately recognizable to you as a 'bell curve'. This curve is ubiquitious because under real world conditions most observations are distributed in such a manner. In fact, this is the bell curve for IQ (Intelligence Quotient). You've probably seen this before, and understand it. It tells us that the average IQ is 100, and that the number of people that have IQs higher or lower than that drops off as they get further away from 100. It's hard to see the exact number, but we can see that very few people have an IQ over 150 or under 50, but a lot have an IQ of 90 or 110. \n",
      "\n",
      "This curve is not unique to IQ distributions - a vast amount of natural phenomena exhibits this sort of distribution, including the sensors that we use in filtering problems. As we will see, it also has all the attributes that we are looking for - it represents a unimodal belief or value as a probabilitiy, it is continuous, and it is computationally efficient. We will soon discover that it also other desirable qualities that we do not yet recognize we need.\n",

      "#### Nomenclature\n",
      "\n",
      "A bit of nomenclature before we continue - this chart depicts the probability of of a *random variable* having any value between ($-\\infty..\\infty)$. For example, for this chart the probability of the variable being 100 is roughly 2.7%, whereas the probability of it being 80 is around 1%.\n",
      "> *Random variable* will be precisely defined later. For now just think of it as a variable that can 'freely' and 'randomly' vary. A dog's position in a hallway, air temperature, and a drone's height above the ground are all random variables. The position of the North Pole is not, nor is a sin wave (a sin wave is anything but 'free').\n",
      "\n",
      "You may object that human IQs cannot be less than zero, let alone $-\\infty$. This is true, but this is a common limitation of mathematical modelling. \"The map is not the territory\" is a common expression, and it is true for Bayesian filtering and statistics. The Gaussian distribution above very closely models the distribution of IQ test results, but being a model it is necessarily imperfect. The difference between model and reality will come up again and again in these filters. \n",
      "\n",
      "You will see these distributions called *Gaussian distributions*, *normal distributions*, and *bell curves*. Bell curve is ambiguous because there are other distributions which also look bell shaped but are not Gaussian distributions, so we will not use it further in this book. But *Gaussian* and *normal* both mean the same thing, and are used interchangeably. I will use both throughout this book as different sources will use either term, and so I want you to be used to seeing both. Finally, as in this paragraph, it is typical to shorten the name and just talk about a *Gaussian* or *normal* - these are both typical shortcut names for the *Gaussian distribution*. "

      "So what does this curve *mean*? Assume for a moment that we have a themometer, which reads 22$\\,^{\\circ}C$. No thermometer is perfectly accurate, and so we normally expect that thermometer will read $\\pm$ that temperature by some amount each time we read it. Furthermore, a theorem called  **Central Limit Theorem** states that if we make many measurements that the measurements will be normally distributed. If that is true, then this chart can be interpreted as a continuous curve depicting our belief that the temperature is any given temperature. In this curve, we assign a probability of the temperature being exactly $22\\,^{\\circ}$ is 19.95%. Looking to the right, we assign the probability that the temperature is $24\\,^{\\circ}$ is 12.10%. Because of the curve's symmetry, the probability of $20\\,^{\\circ}$ is also 12.10%.\n",

Gaussians allow me to capture an infinite number of possible values with only two numbers! With the values $\\mu=22$ and $\\sigma^2=4$ I can compute the probability of the temperature being $22\\,^{\\circ}C$, of $20\\,^{\\circ}C$, of $87.3429\\,^{\\circ}C$, or any other arbitrary value.\n",

      "So what is this telling us? The blue gaussian is very narrow. It is saying that we believe x=23, and that we are very sure about that (90%). In contrast, the red gaussian also believes that x=23, but we are much less sure about that (18%%). Our believe that x=23 is lower, and so our belief about the likely possible values for x is spread out - we think it is quite likely that x=20 or x=26, for example. The blue gaussian has almost completely eliminated 22 or 24 as possible value - their probability is almost 0%, whereas the red curve considers them nearly as likely as 23.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we think back to the thermometer, we can consider these three curves as representing the readings from 3 different thermometers. The blue curve represents a very accurate thermometer, and the red one represents a fairly inaccurate one. Green of course represents one in between the two others. Note the very powerful property the Gaussian distribution affords us - we can entirely represent both the reading and the error of a thermometer with only two numbers - the mean and the variance.\n",

      "The standard notation for a normal distribution for a random variable $X$ is just $X \\sim\\ \\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\sigma^2)$ where $\\mu$ is the mean and $\\sigma^2$ is the variance. It may seem odd to use $\\sigma$ squared - why not just $\\sigma$? We will not go into great detail about the math at this point, but in statistics $\\sigma$ is the *standard deviation* of a normal distribution. *Variance* is defined as the square of the standard deviation, hence $\\sigma^2$.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is worth spending a few words on standard deviation now. The standard deviation is a measure of how much variation from the mean exists. For Gaussian distributions, 68% of all the data falls within one standard deviation($1\\sigma$) of the mean, 95% falls within two standard deviations ($2\\sigma$), and 99.7% within three ($3\\sigma$). This is often called the 68-95-99.7 rule. So if you were told that the average test score in a class was 71 with a standard deviation of 9.4, you could conclude that 95% of the students received a score between 52.2 and 89.8 if the distribution is normal (that is calculated with $71 \\pm (2 * 9.4)$).

      "Recall how our discrete Bayesian filter worked. We had a vector implemented as a numpy array representing our belief at a certain moment in time. When we performed another measurement using the *sense()* function we had to multiply probabilities together, and when we performed the motion step using the *update()* function we had to shift and add probabilities. I've promised you that the Kalman filter uses essentially the same process, and that  it uses Gaussians instead of histograms, so you might reasonable expect that we will be multipling, adding, and shifting Gaussians in the Kalman filter.\n",
      "\n",
      "A typical textbook would directly launch into a multipage proof of the behavior of Gaussians under these operations, but I don't see the value in that right now. I think the math will be much more intuitive and clear if we just start developing a Kalman filter using Gaussians. I will provide the equations for multiplying and shifting Gaussians at the appropriate time. You will then be able to develop a physical intuition for what these operations do, rather than be forced to digest a lot of fairly abstract math.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key point, which I will only assert for now, is that all the operations are very simple, and that they preserve the properties of the Gaussian. This is somewhat remarkable, in that the Gaussian is a nonlinear function, and typically if you multiply a nonlinear equation with itself you end up with a different equation. For example, the shape of $sin(x)sin(x)$ is very different from $sin(x)$. But the result of multiplying two Gaussians is yet another Gaussian. This is a fundamental discovery, and the key reason why Kalman filters are possible"

      "# Multidimensional Kalman Filters\n",
      "\n",
      "The techniques in the last chapter are very powerful, but they only work in one dimension. The gaussians represent a mean and variance that are scalars - real numbers. They provide no way to represent multidimensional data, such as the position of a dog in a field. You may retort that you could use two Kalman filters for that case, one tracks the x coordinate and the other tracks the y coordinate. That does work in some cases, but put that thought aside, because soon you will see some enormous benefits to implementing the multidimensional case.\n",

      "What might a multivariate (meaning multidimensional) normal distribution look like? Our goal is to be able to represent a normal distribution across multiple dimensions. Consider the 2 dimensional case. Let's say we believe that x = 2 and y = 7. Therefore we can see that for N dimensions, we need N means, like so:\n",

      "$$\n",
      "\n",
      "The next step is representing our variances. At first blush we might think we would also need N variances for N dimensions. We might want to say the variance for x is 10 and the variance for y is 8. While this is possible, it does not consider the more general case. For example, suppose we were tracking house prices vs total $m^2$ of the floor plan. These numbers are *correlated*. It is not an exact correlation, but in general houses in the same neighborhood are more expensive if they have a larger floor plan. We want a way to express not only what we think the variance is in the price and the $m^2$, but also the degree to which they are correlated. It turns out that we use a matrix to denote this:\n",

In other words, we believe that he is positioned at (2,7) with a variance of $\\sigma^2=2$ for both x and y. The contour plot shows where we believe the dog is located with the '+' in the center of the ellipse. The ellipse shows the boundary for the $1\\sigma^2$ probability - points where the dog is quite likely to be based on our current knowledge. Of course, the dog might be very far from this point, as Gaussians allow the mean to be any value. For example, the dog could be at (3234.76,189989.62), but that has vanishing low probability of being true. Generally speaking displaying  the $1\\sigma^2$ to $2\\sigma^2$ contour captures the most likely values for the distribution. An equivelent way of thinking about this is the circle/ellipse shows us the amount of error in our belief. A tiny circle would indicate that we have a very small error, and a very large circle indicates a lot of error in our belief. We will use this throughout the rest of the book to display and evaluate the accuracy of our filters at any point in time. \n",

When we look at it we can immediately tell that we have a lot more uncertainty in the y value vs the x value. Our belief that the value is (2,7) is the same in both cases, but errors are different. This sort of thing happens naturally as we track objects in the world - one sensor has a better view of the object, or is closer, than another sensor, and so we end up with different error rates in the different axis.\n",

This is the first contour that has values in the off-diagonal elements of $cov$, and this is the first contour plot with a slanted ellipse. This is not a coincidence. The two facts are telling use the same thing. A slanted ellipse tells us that the x and y values are somehow **correlated**. We denote that in the covariance matrix with values off the diagonal. What does this mean in physical terms? Think of trying to park your car in a parking spot. You can not pull up beside the spot and then move sideways into the space because most cars cannot go purely sideways. $x$ and $y$ are not independent. This is a consequence of the steering system in a car. When your tires are turned the car rotates around its rear axle while moving forward. Or think of a horse attached to a pivoting exercise bar in a corral. The horse can only walk in circles, he cannot vary $x$ and $y$ independently, which means he cannot walk straight forward to to the side. If $x$ changes, $y$ must also change in a defined way. \n",

      "So when we see this ellipse we know that $x$ and $y$ are correlated, and that the correlation is \"strong\". I will not prove it here, but a 45 $^{\\circ}$ angle denotes complete correlation between $x$ and $y$, whereas $0$ and $90$ denote no correlation at all. Those who are familiar with this math will be objecting quite strongly, as this is actually quite sloppy language that does not adress all of the mathematical issues. They are right, but for now this is a good first approximation to understanding these ellipses from a physical interpretation point of view. The size of the ellipse shows how much error we have in each axis, and the slant shows how strongly correlated the values are.\n",

So long as the aircraft does not alter its velocity the velocity allows us to predict where the next position is. After a relatively small amount of error in velocity the probability that it is a good match with the position is very small. Think about it - if you suddenly change direction your position is also going to change a lot. If the position measurement is not in the direction of the assumed velocity change it is very unlikely to be true.

      "So in general terms we can show how a multidimensional Kalman filter works. In the example above, we compute velocity from the previous position measurements using something called the **measurement function**. Then we predict the next position by using the current estimate and something called the **state transition function**. In our example above, *new_position = old_position + velocity&ast;time*. Next, we take the measurement from the sensor, and compare it to the prediction we just made. In a world with perfect sensors and perfect airplanes the prediction will always match the measured value. In the real world they will always be at least slightly different. We call the difference between the two the **residual**. Finally, we use something called the **Kalman gain** to update our estimate to be somewhere between the measured position and the predicted position. I will not describe how the gain is set, but suppose we had perfect confidence in our measurement - no error is possible. Then, clearly, we would set the gain so that 100% of the position came from the measurement, and 0% from the prediction. At the other extreme, if he have no confidence at all in the sensor (maybe it reported a hardware fault), we would set the gain so that 100% of the position came from the prediction, and 0% from the measurement. In normal cases, we will take a ratio of the two: maybe 53% of the measurement, and 47% of the prediction. The gain is updated on every cycle based on the variance of the variables (in a way yet to be explained). It should be clear that if the variance of the measurement is low, and the variance of the prediction is high we will favor the measurement, and vice versa. \n",

However, the new measurement $x^{'}=1.3$, giving a residual $r=0.7$. Finally, Kalman filter gain $k$ gives us a new estimate of $\\hat{x^{'}}=1.8$.\n",
